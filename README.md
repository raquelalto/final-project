##  Machine Learning Project

### Overview Report 


### Data

For this project NHL game data (https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis/nhl-game-data) was used and extracted from CSV files. 

### Analysis
This project will be working with seasons 14’-15’ to 18’-19’

Using the Pandas library in Jupyter Notebook, the data will be transformed into dataframes which will contain:
player_info (player_id), game_skater_stats(contains team ID), game_goalie_stats, team_info

Visualizations will be generated using MatPlotLib. 

The project will be hosted on GitHub.
